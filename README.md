# MyFirstApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

## Route - Absolute vs Relative

An absolute route is specifying its route all the way from the route root, such as /products/2/orders , whereas a relative route is aware of its context. A relative route might therefore look like /orders , given that it is aware of it already being at /products/2 , so the full route would read as /products/2/orders .

## Important: Redirection Path Matching

In our example, we didn't encounter any issues when we tried to redirect the user. But that's not always the case when adding redirections.

By default, Angular matches paths by prefix. That means, that the following route will match both /recipes  and just / 

{ path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else' } 

Actually, Angular will give you an error here, because that's a common gotcha: This route will now ALWAYS redirect you! Why?

Since the default matching strategy is "prefix" , Angular checks if the path you entered in the URL does start with the path specified in the route. Of course every path starts with ''  (Important: That's no whitespace, it's simply "nothing").

To fix this behavior, you need to change the matching strategy to "full" :

{ path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else', pathMatch: 'full' } 

Now, you only get redirected, if the full path is ''  (so only if you got NO other content in your path in this example).
