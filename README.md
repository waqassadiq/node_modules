## Route - Absolute vs Relative

An absolute route is specifying its route all the way from the route root, such as /products/2/orders , whereas a relative route is aware of its context. A relative route might therefore look like /orders , given that it is aware of it already being at /products/2 , so the full route would read as /products/2/orders .
